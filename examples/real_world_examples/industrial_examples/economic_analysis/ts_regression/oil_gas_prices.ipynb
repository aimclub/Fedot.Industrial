    "Dataset published on Kaggle3 consists of historical prices of Brent Oil, CrudeOil WTI, Natural Gas, and Heating Oil from 2000 to 2022. This sample of DailyOilGasPrices was created by using 30 consecutive business days of **Crude Oil WTI close prices** and **traded volumes** as **predictors** and the **average natural gas close** price during each 30-day time frame as the **target** variable. The final dataset has 191 2-dimensional time series of length 30, of which 70% were randomly sampled as training data and the remaining 30% as testing data. This type of model could help companies and governments to better analyse and predict economic situations and correlations regarding oil and natural gas.\n",
